The service recognizes the following labels as contribution-friendly:
- ideal-for-contribution
- ideal-for-user-contribution
- status: ideal-for-contribution
- status: first-timers-only
- status/first-timers-only
- community contribution
- contribution welcome
- help wanted
- first-timers-only
- good first issue
- type/help-needed
